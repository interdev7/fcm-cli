# Changelog

## [v1.1.2] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Rich ANSI banner with gradient effects and project information.
- New `banner.go` file to handle CLI branding and usage formatting.

### Fixed

- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent recursive ignoring of the `cmd/fcm/` directory by removing the broad `fcm` pattern.
